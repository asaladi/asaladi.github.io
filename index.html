        <h1>CSE 168 Final Project: A-Trous Wave Filter</h1>
        <p><strong>By:</strong> Annapurna Saladi, Robin James Villareal</p>

        <p>In this project, we implemented a denoiser that operates on noisy images with lower sample counts, and applied the a-trous wave filter to make the image cleaner. We wanted to target the pathtracer sampling, which often generates fireflies and other noise at lower sample counts. Rather than increasing the sample count and using more computational time to generate a less noisy image, we apply the denoising filter.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Maintain buffers of the image’s albedo color, normals, position, and depth.</li>
            <li>Pass the buffers to the denoiser function, which uses a fixed convolution kernel for multi-scale filtering.</li>
            <li>For each pixel, compute weights using nearby pixels in its kernel. The weights are based on features from the buffers to preserve scene detail (see source paper).</li>
            <li>Update the color buffer with the denoised result and return the final image.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            The result we see is expected with how the paper’s denoising works. We would like to note that this filter, while it maintains the sharpness of edges in the scene, loses some of the quality in the materials, such as reflections and shadows. To adjust this, we can tune the sensitivity parameters for each of the features given in the buffer. To maintain the sharpness of edges and distinguishing objects, we keep the sensitivity of the normals to be very high. Since we can see the albedo buffer only reads the diffuse value and changes the observed material of the objects in the scene, we can lower the sensitivity of it. Adjusting these parameters can give up a more desirable looking image that is closer to “truth”.
